Note 16/09/2025:

> (Note: starting Oct. 2020, any new repository is created with the default branch main, not master. And you can rename existing repository default branch from master to main.
> The rest of this 2014 answer has been updated to use "main")
> 
> (The following assumes github.com itself is not down, as eri0o points out in the comments: see www.githubstatus.com to be sure)
> 
> If the GitHub repo has seen new commits pushed to it, while you were working locally, I would advise using:
> 
> git pull --rebase
> git push
> The full syntax is:
> 
> git pull --rebase origin main
> git push origin main
> With Git 2.6+ (Sept. 2015), after having done (once)
> 
> git config --global pull.rebase true
> git config --global rebase.autoStash true
